The BigDecimal class provides operations on double numbers for arithmetic, scale handling, rounding, comparison, format conversion and hashing. It can handle very large and very small floating point numbers with great precision but compensating with the time complexity a bit.
A BigDecimal consists of a random precision integer unscaled value and a 32-bit integer scale. If greater than or equal to zero, the scale is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. If less than zero, the unscaled value of the number is multiplied by 10^(-scale).

Examples:

Input : double a=0.03;
        double b=0.04;
        double c=b-a;
        System.out.println(c);
Output :0.009999999999999998

Input : BigDecimal _a = new BigDecimal("0.03");
        BigDecimal _b = new BigDecimal("0.04");
        BigDecimal _c = _b.subtract(_a);
        System.out.println(_c);
Output :0.01

Need Of BigDecimal

The two java primitive types(double and float) are floating point numbers, which is stored as a binary representation of a fraction and a exponent.
Other primitive types(except boolean) are fixed-point numbers. Unlike fixed point numbers, floating point numbers will most of the times return an answer with a small error (around 10^-19) This is the reason why we end up with 0.009999999999999998 as the result of 0.04-0.03 in the above example.
But BigDecimal provides us with the exact answer.
